# 03 JavaScript: Password Generator

## What I Learned

This weeks homework was a challenge for me. I found out that I am going to have to put more time and practice into trying to understand all I can about javascript. I was able to able to try and make the 
javascript as clear as I could with the comments I left. It was I hard for me to figure out the vars and where all the code needed to be linked.

After everything this was a satisfying assignment because even though it was a challenge, I was able to figure it out and that is the most rewarding part. Also, I was able to get somewhat familiar with using "functions" and "var". From coming into the with zero coding knowledge and very basic computer skills, I can pat myself on the back and be excited about getting an assignment like this finished.

## Your Task

This week’s homework requires you to create an application that an employee can use to generate a random password based on criteria they’ve selected by modifying starter code. This app will run in the browser, and will feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code that you write. It will have a clean and polished user interface that is responsive, ensuring that it adapts to multiple screen sizes.
